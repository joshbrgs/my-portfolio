# My Portfolio

[Live Site](https://www.joshb.io)

## Description

This is my personal portfolio site to display my projects, blog, and resume in a fascinating way.
To build this project, I used `React/NextJS` for my Front-End Framework. I then dabbled in some ThreeJS for the 3D pieces and some SVG interactivity. I wanted to experiment a little bit and use `Typescript` in the project (it is awesome). I prefer to use `Sass` when it comes to styling so that is exactly what I utilized. I chose to experiment with some `Framer Motion`, and `React Spring` in the project as well. I am utilizing Next's API `NodeJS` and `MongoDB` so that Next can still deliver sever-side rendering. I wanted to experiment in `Go` so in the future I may refactor to that, and this site is the conglamoration of these tools!
